I read the whole of the cradle and grew by around about 5,000 followers using all the tips and tricks and strategies that Tick Tock is recommending to how to be successful on this app there is a lot to read so I did it for you and this is part two of the highlights tip one audio apparently audio is really really important to Tik Tok so also make sure that you're if you attach a sound to your talking make sure that the sound is not overpowering your voice this can really take away from the video and then make you lose attention to make a lot of emphasis about the sound and I guess this is why a lot of trending sounds go viral so this is where the quality of audio is very very important so don't be scared to project your voice and be clear when you're speaking recording videos try to move around and change your background as you think this makes the audience so like the video is moving and keeps their attention a bit longer because his car was not by accident but try to do stuff like this where it feels like you've just caught you in a moment that makes the audience feel like this is an organic moment that hasn't been curated even though you know slightly has she talked really wants you to use native features so filters are basically exclusive to take off and you'll see filter like this be kind of trending all over tiktok and there's a reason why cuz it's marketing for has a platform even if you repurpose this content onto Instagram or SnapChat people are going to I want to get involved where is this field oh it's on tiktok which means they have to come on to take off this is all basically a market itself and basically show that the features that you get here you're not going to get anywhere else so you have to have tiktok if you want to be in with what's trending of course it's only right for me
